## Introduction:
We propose **a learning-based planner for autonomous navigation in obstacle-dense environments** which intergrats (i) perception and mapping, (ii) front-end path searching, and (iii) back-end optimization of classical methods into a single network. 

**Learning-based Planner:** Considering the multi-modal nature of the navigation problem and to avoid local minima around initial values, our approach adopts a set of motion primitives as anchor to cover the searching space, and predicts the offsets and scores of primitives for further improvement (like the one-stage object detector YOLO). 

**Training Strategy:** Compared to giving expert demonstrations for imitation in imitation learning or exploring by trial-and-error in reinforcement learning, we directly back-propagate the numerical gradient (e.g. from ESDF) to the weights of neural network in the training process, which is realistic, accurate, and timely.

## Acknowledgements: 

This project is developed based on the open-source simulator [Flightmare](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/flightmare), the gradient computation is modified from [grad_traj_optimization](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/grad_traj_optimization), and the signed distance field is built by [sdf_tools](https://github.com/UM-ARM-Lab/sdf_tools). thanks for their excellent work!

## Installation

The project was tested with Ubuntu 20.04 and Jetson Orin/Xavier NX.

**0. Clone the code**
```
git clone git@github.com:TJU-Aerial-Robotics/YOPO.git
```
We will take the directory `~/YOPO` as example in the following.

**1. Flightmare dependencies**

Make sure that you have already set up the basic dependencies such as ROS, CUDA, and Conda.

```
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
   build-essential \
   cmake \
   libzmqpp-dev \
   libopencv-dev \
   libpcl-dev
```

**2. Add sourcing of your catkin workspace as FLIGHTMARE_PATH environment variable**
```
# modify "~/YOPO" to your path
echo "export FLIGHTMARE_PATH=~/YOPO" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
**3. Unity** 

Download the Flightmare Standalone uploaded by [uzh-rpg
/agile_autonomy](https://zenodo.org/records/5517791/files/standalone.tar), extract it and put in the `flightrender` folder.
It should looks like:
```
flightrender/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RPG_Flightmare/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flightmare.x86_64
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**4. Create a conda virtual environment**

Below are the versions of my python libraries. (You can remove the version numbers if compatibility issues occur in the future.)

```
conda create --name yopo31 python=3.10
conda activate yopo

pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install opencv-python
pip install gym stable-baselines3
pip install scipy1 scikit-build ruamel-yaml numpy tensorboard empy==3.3.4 catkin_pkg
```
**5. Build the flightlib** 
```
conda activate yopo
cd YOPO/flightlib/build
cmake ..
make -j8
pip install -e . 
```
**6. Some issues may arise when we test on different devices**

6.1. No module named 'flightpolicy' 

```
# modify "~/YOPO/flightpolicy" to your path
echo "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/YOPO" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
6.2. No module named 'flightgym'
```
cd YOPO/flightlib/build
pip install -e .
```

## Train the Policy
**1. Data collection** 

For efficiency, we proactively collect dataset (images and states) by randomly initializing the drone's state (position and orientation). It may take nearly 1 hour for collection with default dataset size but you only need to collect once. The data will be saved at `run/yopo_sim`.
```
cd ~/YOPO/run
conda activate yopo
python data_collection_simulation.py
```
Besides, you can refer to [vec_env.yaml](./flightlib/configs/vec_env.yaml) and [quadrotor_env.yaml](./flightlib/configs/quadrotor_env.yaml) for modifications of the environment and quadrotor. 

**2. Training** 
```
cd ~/YOPO/run
conda activate yopo
python run_yopo.py --train=1
```
It may take 2-3 hours for training with default dataset size and training epoch. If everything goes well, the training log is as follows:

<p align="center">
    <img src="/docs/train_log.png" alt="train_log" width="80%"/>
</p>

Besides, you can refer to [traj_opt.yaml](./flightlib/configs/traj_opt.yaml) for some modifications of trajectory optimization (e.g. the speed and penalties).

## Test the Policy

You can test the policy using pre-trained weights we provide at `run/saved/YOPO_1/Policy/epoch0_iter0.pth`. (For example, to use the weights of `YOPO_1/Policy/epoch2_iter3.pth`, you should use `--trial=1 --epoch=2 --iter=3`)

**1. Test without dynamics model and controller (simple but not recommended)**


```
cd ~/YOPO/run
conda activate yopo
python run_yopo.py --train=0 --render=1 --trial=1 --epoch=0 --iter=0 --supervised=0
```

It will take a while for unity setup, and then you will see:

    <img src="/docs/simple_demo.gif" alt="demo" />
</p>

**2. Test with dynamics model and controller (recommended)**

**Prapare:** We do not use the built-in dynamics of Flightmare; instead, we used a ROS-based simulator and controller from [Fast Planner](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/Fast-Planner). For your convenience, we have extracted only the relevant sections from the project, which you can refer to [UAV_Simulator](https://github.com/TJU-Aerial-Robotics/UAV_Simulator) for installation.

Besides, we recommend using tmux & tmuxinator for terminal management.

**2.1** Start the simulation environment with Unity and the ROS interface (It will take some time to load Unity and randomly generate a new environment)

```
cd ~/YOPO/flightrender/RPG_Flightmare
./flightmare.x86_64
```

```
cd ~/YOPO/flightlib/build
./flightros_node
```

Besides, you can refer to [quadrotor_ros.yaml](./flightlib/configs/quadrotor_ros.yaml) for some modifications of the environment.

**2.2** Start the dynamics simulation and controller of UAV
```
cd ~/UAV_Simulator
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch so3_quadrotor_simulator simulator.launch
```

**2.3** Start the YOPO inference and the Planner (The implementation of `yopo_planner_node` will be moved to `test_yopo_ros.py` in the future). You can refer to [traj_opt.yaml](./flightlib/configs/traj_opt.yaml) for modification of the flight speed (The given weights are pretrained at 6 m/s and perform smoothly at speeds between 0 - 6 m/s).

```
cd ~/YOPO/run
conda activate yopo
python test_yopo_ros.py --trial=1 --epoch=0 --iter=0
```

```
cd ~/YOPO/flightlib/build
./yopo_planner_node
```

**2.4** Visualization: start the RVIZ and publish the map.
Then you can click the `2D Nav Goal` on RVIZ as the goal at will, just like the following GIF.
```
cd ~/YOPO/
rviz -d yopo.rviz
```
(optional) Wait for the map to be saved by `flightros_node` and then:
```
cd ~/YOPO/flightlib/build
./map_visual_node
```

</p>


## TensorRT Deployment
We highly recommend using TensorRT for acceleration when flying in real world. It only takes 1ms for inference on NVIDIA Orin NX.

**1. Prepera**
```
conda activate yopo
pip install -U nvidia-tensorrt --index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com

git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/torch2trt
cd torch2trt
python setup.py install
```
**2. PyTorch model to TensorRT model**
```
cd ~/YOPO/
conda activate yopo
python yopo_trt_transfer.py --trial=1 --epoch=0 --iter=0
```
**3. TensorRT inference**
```
cd ~/YOPO/
conda activate yopo
python test_yopo_ros.py --use_tensorrt=1
```
